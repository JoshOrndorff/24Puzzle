This program solves to problem of making 24 by combining 4 given numbers, and using the operations +, -, *, /.

For example if the numbers are 2, 3, 5, 8, it produces:
8 * 2 + 3 + 5

It also solves difficult problem classes that other solvers miss such as:
6 / (1 - 3 / 4)
(2 * 5) + (2 * 7)

It does not yet allow combining numbers such as 1 and 3 to make 13.
It also makes no effort to avoid duplicate solutions
-- #TODO make chunk class have a structure member to detect dupes.
